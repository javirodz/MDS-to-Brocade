# MDS-to-Brocade
This code defines a function called generate_brocade_config that takes an input string representing a Brocade zoning configuration as an argument, and returns a string of Brocade commands that can be used to configure a Brocade Fibre Channel switch. The function first initializes several variables, including a list of Brocade commands (brocade_cmds), as well as lists for storing information about zones, members, and aliases. It then parses the input string, extracting relevant information such as zone names and members, and generates corresponding Brocade commands to create and configure the zones. If there are any member PWWNs, the function also creates aliases for those members. Finally, the function generates commands to create a Brocade configuration using the zone set name, adds the zones to the configuration, and saves and enables the configuration. The function then returns the list of Brocade commands as a single string, separated by newline characters. The main function calls generate_brocade_config with a sample input string and prints the resulting output.
